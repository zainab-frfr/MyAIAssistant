# My AI Assistant

A productivity application developed using Flutter, designed to help users efficiently schedule their daily tasks. Users input tasks with or 
without time constraints, and the app generates all possible schedules for the day, allowing users to select their preferred schedule. 

The backend is written in Python and hosted on PythonAnywhere, with Flask API to connect with the frontend. 

A modified Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) algorithm with arc consistency is implemented to produce all possible schedules, not just one. 
Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database are integrated for user management and data storage, ensuring seamless and secure 
user experiences.
